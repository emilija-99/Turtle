# Turtle 

#### Description:
<h1>Welcome to Turtle App 🐢</h1>
<p>
    Ever feel like you’ve got too much going on and need something to help keep it all together? Meet Turtle App! It’s your new, trusty companion that helps you keep track of your progress every day—slow and steady, just like a wise old turtle.
</p>
<h2>What’s Inside the Turtle Shell? 🐢</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Progress Bar</strong>: Watch your progress grow—like a plant you water just enough to keep it alive.</li>
    <li><strong>Todo</strong>: Got things to do? Move your tasks around until you finally check them off.</li>
    <li><strong>Note</strong>: Perfect for jotting down your brilliant ideas or reminders to buy milk.</li>
    <li><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: Stay on track with the Pomodoro technique—because who doesn’t love working in tomato-sized chunks of time?</li>
    <li><strong>Weekly Goals</strong>: Set goals you’re totally going to crush this week… or maybe next week.</li>
    <li><strong>Habit Tracker</strong>: Keep an eye on those daily habits, whether it’s drinking more water or finally learning that song on the guitar.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Customize your space like it’s your own! You can turn any of these features on or off based on what you need. And the best part? All your data is stored safely in a local database, so it’s always there when you need it.
</p>
<p>
    I’m still working on making Turtle App your ultimate sidekick, but it’s already shaping up to be a great tool to keep life organized. Don’t worry—you don’t need to be a coding genius to use it. Just have fun and enjoy the journey!
</p>
<p>
    Got any ideas? I’d love to hear them! If there’s something you’d like to see in Turtle App, let me know. Together, we can make it even better.
